# Tidal model of the Spermonde Archipelago
This repository contains the results of a DELFT 3D model run, that simulates tides in the Spermonde Archipelago from Jan 1 2017 to Jan 1 2019. The model was set up with Delft Dashboard, following the tutorial at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3grdR4rYVY

A detailed description of Delft Dashboard can be found here:

## Model files
The model files (DELFT 3D model files and resulting NEFIS map file) are available via ZENODO: 
The NEFIS files can be opened via QuickPlot (DELFT 3D) or OpenEarthTools. The Zenodo repository also contains a \*.mat file exported with QuickPlot, that can be opened with Matlab or Octave. 

## Model boundary conditions
Boundary conditions were derived from astronomic forcing from the TPXO 7.2 Global Inverse tide model, described here:
